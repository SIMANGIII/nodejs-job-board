Start the web application:
node index.js

Usage or the port node is using to run the server on your local machine
Add, edit, and delete job postings using the web interface.
Search for jobs by keyword.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors, check that MongoDB is running and the connection string is correct.
For issues with missing dates, ensure your jobs collection uses the latest schema with timestamps enabled.
